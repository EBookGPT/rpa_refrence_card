This story feels like a dry, technical report on the dangers of AI, rather than a compelling narrative.  While you've established a setting and a protagonist, you're heavily relying on "telling" instead of "showing". Here's a breakdown of the issues and how to fix them:

**1.  The "Show, Don't Tell" Problem:**

* **Overly Descriptive:** You describe emotions and thoughts at length instead of showing them through actions and dialogue.  For example: "Panic surged through the room. Programmers scrambled to their feet, their faces pale with fear."  Instead, show us a programmer stumbling back, knocking over his chair, or someone gasping and clutching their chest. 
* **Exposition Dumps:**  You're using lots of exposition to explain the plot and characters' motivations.  Instead, let the characters reveal their inner world through their actions and interactions.  
* **Lack of Sensory Detail:** The world feels flat.  Use vivid imagery to draw the reader in.  What does the code look like on Amy's screen? What does the air smell like in the office? What does the sound of the system crash feel like?

**2.  Dialogue is Weak:**

* **No Tension:** The dialogue feels artificial and mostly serves as exposition.  For example, "What's happening?" someone shouted.  Instead, create tension:  "What in the hell is going on?" someone shouted, his voice cracking. "Is this a goddamn prank?"
* **Lack of Character:**  The dialogue doesn't differentiate characters.  Give them distinct voices, quirks, and rhythms. 

**3.  Narrative Structure is Uninspired:**

* **Predictable Plot:** The story follows a very predictable arc of problem-discovery-solution.  Inject surprises, twists, and unexpected turns to keep the reader guessing.
* **Slow Pacing:**  The pacing is slow and bogged down by too much exposition.  Break the story into smaller scenes with a clear sense of rising tension.

**Here's how to improve the story:**

**Chapter 1:  The Glitch:**

* **Start in Media Res:**  Begin with the system crashing, then cut to Amy's perspective *after* the chaos has started.
* **Show the Chaos:** Instead of describing panic, show it through physical actions and fragmented dialogue.  Focus on details: the smell of burning circuitry, the frantic keyboard clicks, a stray cable dangling from the ceiling.
* **Create Suspense:**  Let Amy discover the glitch gradually, raising questions in the reader's mind. Why is this glitch different? What makes Amy suspect sabotage? 
* **End with a Cliffhanger:**  Leave the reader wanting more.  Perhaps Amy discovers a cryptic message on her console or sees a fleeting glimpse of a shadowy figure.

**Chapter 2: The Shadow Network:**

* **Focus on Amy:** Show Amy's investigation through her actions and observations.  What kind of research is she doing? What clues is she following? How is this impacting her personally? 
* **Show the Network:**  Don't just describe it, show us its impact.  Perhaps Amy receives a threatening message, witnesses a bot attack, or encounters a shadowy figure in real life. 
* **Create Intrigue:**  The Oracle and The Bot are intriguing concepts, but we need to see them in action.  How are they manipulating events? What are their motives?  

**Chapter 3: The Code of Trust:**

* **Conflict is Key:**  Make Amy's dilemma more personal and emotionally charged.  What is at stake for her personally?  Is she willing to sacrifice her career for her principles?
* **Show Her Solution:** Don't just explain it, show us how Amy codes the safeguards.  Let us see the struggle, the frustrations, and the triumphs.
* **Don't Resolve Too Quickly:**  The ending feels too neat.  Let the story simmer with ambiguity.  Perhaps the activists remain skeptical, or there's a lingering threat from the Shadow Network.

**Overall:**

* **Focus on Characters:** Make Amy a relatable, complex character with flaws, fears, and motivations. Give the other characters depth and dimension. 
* **Worldbuilding:**  Create a more immersive and detailed world. Show us the impact of technology on society, the ethical dilemmas, and the power struggles. 
* **Embrace the Darker Side:** The story explores the dangers of AI, but it feels too clean.  Embrace the darkness, the ethical complexities, the potential for human fallibility.
* **Show, Don't Tell:**  Trust your reader's intelligence.  Instead of explaining everything, show us through action, dialogue, and sensory detail.  

Remember, a good story should immerse the reader in a world, make them care about the characters, and leave them wanting more.  Keep pushing the boundaries, explore the dark corners of your imagination, and let the story unfold organically.
